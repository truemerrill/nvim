# Neovim config

A lua-based neovim configuration following the [Neovim-from-scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) tutorial series.  This configuration also sets up custom commands and keybindings that I prefer to use.

## Plugins / features

- Language Server Protocols (LSP)
- :ToggleExplorer to show/hide the NetrwTreeListing, similar to NERDTree but with builtin features
- Telescope 

## Install

```bash
mkdir -m ~/.config/
git clone https://gitlab.com/truemerrill/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```
